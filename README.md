This site acts as a Hub of stuff I have made that I can easily send to people.

## Stuff Included:

+ A collection of games I have made to learn the [Phaser Framework](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
The first game (Buggy) was made by [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

+ A price calculator for Karuta Cards using the players inventory spreadsheet. Adopted in from [This Project](https://github.com/TheKLCD/karuta-calculator).

Enjoy! :D
